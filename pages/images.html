        <h2>mochi examples</h2>
        <p>there are 4 main types of images used on the web: .jpg, .gif, .png and .svg</p>
        <p>jpg images are designed for handling large color palettes without exorbitantly increasing file size</p>
        <img src="../img/images/mochi.jpg" alt="jpg of a mochi">
        <p>this type of image does not support transparent pixels</p>

        <p>gifs are designed for simple animations with limited color palettes</p>
        <img src="../img/images/mochi.gif" alt="gif of a bouncing mochi">
        <p>gifs do support transparent pixels but only as a binary option</p>

        <p>pngs are great for anything that is not a photo or animated</p>
        <img src="../img/images/mochi.png" alt="png of a mochi">
        <p>pngs allow for opaque pixels making them great for logo designs or icons</p>

        <p>svg is a vector-based graphics format, meaning it can scale up or down to any dimension without loss of quality</p>
        <img src="../img/images/mochi.svg" alt="svg of a mochi">
        <p>svgs have all the pros of pngs and should be used wherever possible</p>
